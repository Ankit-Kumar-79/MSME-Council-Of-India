                        Unemployment is a worldwide problem which is currently
                        the major problem of not only underdeveloped but also
                        developed nations. The main reason for unemployment is
                        excess population growth, illiteracy and lack of money
                        which at present remains the cause of a great
                        disappointment in all classes. In which it can be said
                        that the excessive growth of population is less than the
                        growth of employment opportunities due to which
                        unemployment is increasing excessively.

                        Poverty in India is also a major reason for any person
                        to be unemployed. Due to poverty in the country, proper
                        resources are not available to the people and apart from
                        this the poor person is also deprived of a good
                        education. Because of which he is not able to get a good
                        employment and a large number of sections remain
                        unemployed. To encourage such unemployed people to get
                        employment by giving detailed information about
                        <strong>“MSME”</strong> industries by

                        The <strong>“MAKE IN INDIA”</strong> scheme was launched
                        by the illustrious Prime Minister of India,
                        <strong>Shri Narendra Modi ji</strong>, as part of a
                        wider set of nation-building initiatives.• The main
                        objective of the <strong>“MAKE IN INDIA”</strong> scheme
                        of the Government of India is to make the country a hub
                        of product production so that by manufacturing all the
                        products in the country, they work for exporting to
                        their country as well as other countries. And work to
                        make India’s economy more strong. Under this mission,
                        the objective of Honorable Prime Minister Modi is also
                        that the products used everyday in people’s lives can be
                        manufactured in India only.

                      <p>
                        Under this mission, the production of the product should
                        be maximum in India and the price of the product should
                        also be reduced and the country’s economy should get
                        maximum benefits by exporting the product to other
                        countries. When more and more products are made inside
                        the country, then this will increase the employment in
                        the country, people will get employment and the level of
                        unemployment in India will decrease.

                      <p>
                        When the production of the product will be done inside
                        the country, then the tax on the product coming from
                        outside will be saved, so that the citizens of India
                        will get the good quality product at a low cost and due
                        to the manufacturing of the product in the country, the
                        investors of other countries will come to our country.
                        Will invest money so that money from other countries
                        will come to our country, this will further improve the

                        stipulated time (for example, if the loan tenure is 10
                        years and the borrower has repaid the loan amount
                        honestly on time for 8 years except that due to some

                        <strong>Prime Minister Modi ji</strong>. The meaning of
                        this slogan is that not only the products made in the
                        country should be used but they should also be promoted
                        at their own level so that more and more people become
                        aware of the use of indigenous products. If the local
                        products of the country are promoted under this
                        campaign, then small traders will develop.

                        India is an agricultural country. Agriculture is the
                        backbone of the Indian economy and about 52 percent of
                        the country’s total labor force earns its livelihood
                        from agriculture and its allied industries and
                        businesses. At present, due to population explosion, the
                        agricultural sector has lagged behind, because the
                        nature of agricultural work is very backward, lack of
                        techniques in agricultural work, unemployment has
                        increased due to lack of institutional reforms like land
                        reform, ram consolidation, landholding limit etc. Apart
                        from tenancy reform, and some political and
                        administrative inefficiency and lack of sense of
                        cooperation in the behavior of farmers is also the main
                        reason, The problem of unemployment has also increased
                        due to non-availability of good opportunities for
                        agriculture, a lot of rural population migrated to the
